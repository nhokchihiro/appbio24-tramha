This assignment requires writing a Makefile and a markdown report.

You can reuse the Makefile developed for your previous assignment, which generated a VCF file.

Evaluate the effects of a few variants in your VCF file. You may use a software tool like VEP or snpEff or you may even use you eye and IGV to describe what effect a variant might have on a region.

Write a markdown report that describes the process and the results.
