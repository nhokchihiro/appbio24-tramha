This assignment requires writing a Makefile and a markdown report.

You can reuse the Makefile developed for your previous assignment, which generated a VCF file.

Evaluate the effects of the variants in your VCF file.

Try using a software tool like VEP or snpEff.  Add the effect prediction steps to your Makefile and make them part of the workflow.

If, for some reason, you can't make any of the variant effect prediction software work, you may use visual inspection via IGV to describe the effect of variants.

Find variants with different effects.

Write a markdown report that summarizes the process and your results.
