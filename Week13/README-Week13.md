Your submission should include a readme, a makefile, and a design file.

You may re-use code and genomes from your previous submission. You will need a genome and a GTF/GFF annotation reference. You may also perform a transcriptome-based quantification if you choose.

For your genome of interest, find RNA-Seq data at SRA. Most RNA-Seq projects include multiple datasets.

Select at least three SRR datasets from the same project.

Write code to perform an RNA-Seq analysis on each dataset. The final result of your code should be a count matrix that summarizes read counts for each dataset.

Include screenshots from IGV that prove that your data is indeed RNA-Seq data. 

Discuss a few lines of the resulting count matrix. Visually identify rows where the counts show consistent gene expression levels.
