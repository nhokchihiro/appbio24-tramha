When comparing:
- If comparing in rows: you can just compare, but it still a bit tricky since sometimes, one gene can have different transcript lengths.
- If comparing in columns: you should divide by lengths since sometimes, longer reads can have more transcript, but the coverage is just 1 or 2.
- 
Your submission should include a readme, a makefile, and a design file.

You may re-use code and genomes from your previous submission.

Perform a differential expression analysis of a count matrix.

Take a count matrix, this count matrix may be one generated in a previous assignment or one that simulated.

Use method to identify genes/transcripts that show differential expression.

Draw a PCA plot and a heatmap for these genes.

Discuss the results. How many genes have you found. What kind of expression levels can you observe. How reliable does your data seem?
