Your submission should be a link to a folder that contains a script and a report written in Markdown, all committed to your repository.

Part 1: Write a script

In the previous lecture, you wrote a Markdown report. Rewrite all the code from that report as a Bash script. Your script should be:

1. Reusable: separate variable definitions from the code.
2. Documented: include comments that explain what each part of the script does.

Run your script on your original data and verify that it works. You were also assigned to review someone else's report.

Now, run your script on their data. If the script is reusable, you can replace your variables with theirs and run the script. 

Add more functions to the script that also print some of their results. Were you able to reproduce their results? Make a note in the report.

Commit the script to your repository.

Part 2: Make use of ontologies

Sequence Ontology
Choose a feature type from the GFF file and look up its definition in the sequence ontology.
Find both the parent terms and children nodes of the term.
Provide a short discussion of what you found.

Gene Ontology
Identify a CC, MF, and BP term in the gene ontology relevant to your organism with a method of your choice.
Explain the term and show its parent terms and children nodes.
Find genes that are annotated with the term. List the genes.
Discuss how well the genome seems to be annotated and whether the terms you found are broad or narrowly specific.

Submit the link to the folder containing your script and the report.
