Your submission should be a link to a GitHub folder that contains a script and a report written in Markdown, all committed to your repository.

# Part 1: Write a script

```
code work-week04.sh
```

Lecture: AI powered ScriptingLinks to an external site.

In a previous assignment, you wrote a Markdown report on processing a GFF file to count feature types.

Rewrite all the code from that report as a Bash script. Your script should be:

1. Reusable: separate variable definitions from the code.
2. Documented: include comments that explain what each part of the script does.

Run your script on your original data and verify that it works. You were also assigned to review someone else's report.

Now, run your script on their data. If the script is reusable, you can replace your variables with theirs and run the script. 

Add more functions to the script that also print some of their results. Were you able to reproduce their results? Make a note in the report.

Commit the script to your repository.

Part 2: Make use of ontologies

Lecture: Sequence OntologyLinks to an external site.


Choose a feature type from the GFF file and look up its definition in the sequence ontology.
Find both the parent terms and children nodes of the term.
Provide a short discussion of what you found.

Submit the link to the folder containing your script and the report.
