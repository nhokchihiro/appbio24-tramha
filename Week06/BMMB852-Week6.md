This assignment requires writing a script and a markdown report.

Write a script that downloads data from the SRALinks to an external site. or ENALinks to an external site. database and performs a quality control analysis on the data.

When searching for data use the genome you selected for the read simulation assignment as the target organism. Select Illumina or Iontorrent instruments only.

Identify a bad sequencing dataset. You may need to evaluate multiple SRR numbers to find one with poor quality.

Use data generated on the Illumina or Iontorrent platforms.
Write a script to download data from the SRA database.
Evaluate the quality of the downloaded data.
Improve the quality of the reads in the dataset.
Evaluate the quality again and document the improvements.
Your script should include all necessary code. The markdown report should explain the data and publication it corresponds to and present the results of your analysis.

Commit the two files to your repository and submit the link to the folder containing the files.

Tip: Older datasets are often of lower quality the sequencing instruments were less reliable in the past.
